# ZapBot
A Discord bot made with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#) that I work on in my spare time.


By working on this project I hope to get a better understanding of JavaScript and learn about NodeJS.

## Features

The main features I'm hoping to implement are:
* Reminder system
  * Similar to Google Assistant's reminder system
  * Example command: `!remindme <delay> <reminder>`
* Weather forecast
    * Custom favorite location
    * Uses some API ([OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)?)
    * Example command: `!weather <city>`

I want to look into storing the amount of command calls - possibly per user - somehow. This will probably have me learn about something like SQLite.
